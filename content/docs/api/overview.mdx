## API basics

These are internal routes under `/api/*` that the frontend calls.

- `GET`: read data
- `POST`: create/update data

## `GET /api/courses`

Returns a sorted list of courses.

```json
[
  {
    "courseId": 123,
    "courseName": "CSE142",
    "courseFullName": "Computer Programming I"
  }
]
```

## `GET /api/professors`

Returns a sorted list of professors.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 12,
    "name": "Instructor Name"
  }
]
```

## `POST /api/comments`

Creates a course comment and updates aggregate course ratings.

### Response codes

- `201`: comment created
- `400`: invalid payload/value ranges
- `401`: user not authenticated
- `404`: referenced course/professor not found
- `500`: unexpected server error

## Testing tip

Use browser DevTools Network tab to inspect request payload, status code, and response JSON while testing form submission.
