## Branch and PR flow

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Keep commits scoped and readable.
3. Run lint/build before opening PR.
4. Include screenshots for UI changes.
5. Document schema/API contract changes in docs.

## Code quality baseline

- No TypeScript errors
- No obvious hydration issues
- API handlers return explicit status codes
- UI remains responsive on mobile and desktop

## Suggested checks

```bash
bun run lint
bun run build
```
