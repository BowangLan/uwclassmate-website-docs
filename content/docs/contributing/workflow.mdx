## Branch and PR flow

1. Create a feature branch for one focused change.
2. Keep commits small and readable.
3. Run lint/build before opening PR.
4. Add screenshots for UI changes.
5. Update docs when schema/API behavior changes.

## Quality baseline

- No TypeScript errors
- No obvious hydration issues
- API routes return explicit status codes
- UI remains usable on mobile and desktop

## Required checks

```bash
bun run lint
bun run build
```

## Beginner tip

If you are new to PRs: write a short PR description with "what changed", "why", and "how tested" so reviewers can quickly validate your intent.
