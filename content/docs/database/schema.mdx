## How to read this page

Think in terms of entities (tables) and relations (how tables connect).

## Primary entities

- `Courses`
- `CourseRating`
- `CourseCredit`
- `Comments`
- `Professors`
- `Users`
- `UserFavorites`
- `Sessions`

## Forum entities

- `forum_posts`
- `forum_comments`
- `forum_notifications`
- `forum_user_favorites`
- `forum_trendy_posts`

## Source-of-truth files

- Prisma schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Drizzle schema: `src/db/schema.ts`

## Practical notes

- Runtime queries currently use Drizzle.
- Prisma schema is still maintained for visibility/tooling.
- `CourseRating` stores aggregate metrics updated during comment writes.

If you are new: aggregate metrics are precomputed summary values (for example averages) so pages can load faster.
