## Course list page

`/course-rating` runs SQL to load two main course lists (`CourseLists` ids 1 and 2), each with nested course payloads.

## Search

`/course-rating/search` uses `query` search param and SQL `LIKE` matching on `Courses.courseName`.

## Course detail

`/courses/[courseCode]` fetches:

- Course basics and description
- Credit info
- Aggregated rating metrics
- Joined comments + professor names

Also exposed at `/CourseDetail/[courseCode]` via re-export.
