description: Beginner-friendly walkthrough of list, search, and detail pages.

## User journey

Most users go through this flow:

1. Open `/course-rating` to browse course lists.
2. Use `/course-rating/search` to find a specific course.
3. Open `/courses/[courseCode]` for details and comments.

## Course list page

`/course-rating` loads two primary list groups (`CourseLists` ids `1` and `2`) and their nested courses.

## Search page

`/course-rating/search` reads the `query` URL param and uses SQL `LIKE` matching on `Courses.courseName`.

If you are new: SQL `LIKE` is partial text matching (for example, searching part of a course name).

## Course detail page

`/courses/[courseCode]` fetches:

- Course metadata and description
- Credit info
- Aggregated rating metrics
- Joined comments with professor names

Legacy alias route also exists:

- `/CourseDetail/[courseCode]` (re-export)
