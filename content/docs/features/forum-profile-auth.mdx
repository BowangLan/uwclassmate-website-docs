description: Current state of user accounts, profile routes, and forum status.

## Auth integration

- Clerk provider mounts in `src/app/global-wrapper.tsx`
- Clerk middleware runs from `src/middleware.ts`
- Header UI shows sign-in/sign-out and `UserButton`

If you are new: middleware is code that runs before route handling and is useful for auth/session checks.

## Profile route

- `/profile/[[...profile]]` is connected to Clerk profile flow

## Forum status

- `/forum` is currently a placeholder page
- Schema already includes forum tables (`forum_posts`, `forum_comments`, etc.) for future expansion
