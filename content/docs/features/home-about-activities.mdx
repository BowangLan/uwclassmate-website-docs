description: Public-facing pages and where their content comes from.

## Home page

`src/app/page.tsx` composes these sections:

- `Hero`
- `NewlyLaunched`
- `Activities`
- `CTA`

## About page

`src/app/about/page.tsx` contains organization intro + leadership cards (including bilingual content emphasis).

## Activities page

- Route file: `src/app/activities/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Data source: `src/app/data.ts`
- Invalid slug behavior: calls `notFound()`

If you are new: `notFound()` tells Next.js to render the 404 page when content key/slug does not exist.
