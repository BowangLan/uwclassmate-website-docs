## Required env vars

`DATABASE_URL` is required by Drizzle and Prisma.

## Auth requirements

The app uses Clerk (`@clerk/nextjs`). For authenticated flows, set standard Clerk env vars in addition to `DATABASE_URL`.

Typical fields:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

## Runtime behavior

- `src/db/drizzle.ts` loads `.env` and initializes a MySQL connection via `drizzle-orm/mysql2`.
- `src/middleware.ts` runs Clerk middleware for app/API route matching.

## Safety

- Never commit `.env`.
- Avoid hardcoding production connection strings.
- Validate auth in write APIs (already done in `POST /api/comments`).
