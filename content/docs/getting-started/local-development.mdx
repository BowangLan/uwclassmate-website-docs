## What you will do

You will install dependencies, add environment variables, and run a local dev server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `18+`
- Bun (`bun.lock` is included), or npm/pnpm if needed
- A reachable MySQL database

If you are newer to web projects: a "dev server" is a local process that rebuilds and refreshes your app while you code.

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/bowanglan/Dev/uwclassmate-official-frontend-nextjs
bun install
```

## 2. Create `.env`

In the project root, create `.env`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://<user>:<password>@<host>:3306/<database>"
```

If auth features are used, also add Clerk keys (see Environment doc).

## 3. Start development server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 4. Basic quality checks

Run these before pushing code:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run build
```

- `lint`: catches style/code-quality issues
- `build`: catches compile/runtime route issues that may not show in local hot reload

## Useful paths

- App routes: `src/app`
- API handlers: `src/app/api`
- Database adapter: `src/db/drizzle.ts`
- Schema definitions: `src/db/schema.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`

## Common setup issues

- App cannot connect to DB: verify `DATABASE_URL`, host access, and DB credentials.
- Sign-in button errors: verify Clerk keys are set.
- Works in `dev` but fails in `build`: run `bun run build` and fix reported route/type errors.
