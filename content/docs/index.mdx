description: Beginner-friendly docs for the Next.js frontend that powers UWClassmate.
---

This docs site explains the codebase at `/Users/bowanglan/Dev/uwclassmate-official-frontend-nextjs`.

## Start here (new to Next.js/web)

If you are new, follow this order:

1. Read [Local Development](/docs/getting-started/local-development) to run the app.
2. Read [Environment & Secrets](/docs/getting-started/environment) to configure auth and database.
3. Read [Architecture Overview](/docs/architecture/overview) to understand how pages and APIs connect.
4. Explore feature docs after that.

## What this project does

UWClassmate is a University of Washington student platform focused on:

- Course ratings and course detail pages
- Student comments on courses/professors
- Public site pages (home, about, activities)
- Sign-in/profile flows using Clerk

## Tech stack (plain language)

- `Next.js` App Router: page routing and server rendering
- `React + TypeScript`: UI + safer typed code
- `Tailwind + Radix/shadcn`: styling + reusable UI parts
- `Clerk`: authentication (sign-in/sign-up/user sessions)
- `MySQL + Drizzle ORM`: database + typed queries
