## Build commands

```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

## Deployment checklist

- Set production `DATABASE_URL`
- Set Clerk keys for target environment
- Confirm DB network rules allow app runtime access
- Validate `/api/comments` auth + insert path
- Smoke test key pages (`/`, `/course-rating`, `/courses/[courseCode]`, `/submit-comment`)

## Runtime notes

- Home route uses `runtime = "edge"`; validate any environment/runtime restrictions accordingly.
