## Build commands

```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

- `build`: creates optimized production bundle
- `start`: runs production server locally for smoke testing

## Deployment checklist

- Set production `DATABASE_URL`
- Set production Clerk keys
- Confirm DB network access from runtime environment
- Validate `POST /api/comments` auth + insert path
- Smoke test core pages: `/`, `/course-rating`, `/courses/[courseCode]`, `/submit-comment`

## Runtime note

Home route uses `runtime = "edge"`.

If you are new: edge runtime can have environment/library limitations compared to standard Node runtime, so verify compatibility before release.
