## Existing logging points

The codebase includes `console.log` and `console.error` in:

- course and professor API routes
- comment submission route
- course rating and detail render paths

## Practical troubleshooting flow

1. Verify auth state and Clerk session.
2. Check DB connection via `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Reproduce API call with browser network panel.
4. Validate payload ranges for comment submission.
5. Inspect server logs for route-level errors.

## Recommended next step

Adopt structured logging and error reporting (for example request ids, route tags, and centralized error capture) as traffic grows.
