## Current logging

The app currently uses `console.log`/`console.error` in key areas:

- Course and professor API routes
- Comment submission route
- Course rating/detail render paths

## Fast debugging flow

1. Confirm auth state and active Clerk session.
2. Confirm DB connection (`DATABASE_URL`).
3. Reproduce failing request in browser Network panel.
4. Validate comment payload ranges/types.
5. Check server logs for route-level errors.

## Good next improvement

Adopt structured logging and centralized error reporting (request id, route tag, grouped errors) as traffic grows.

If you are new: structured logs are machine-readable logs with consistent fields, which makes debugging in production much easier.
