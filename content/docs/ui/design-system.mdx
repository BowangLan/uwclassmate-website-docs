title: UI and Styling
description: Component organization, styling approach, and navigation behavior.

## Component structure

- Shared UI primitives: `src/components/ui`
- Feature-level components: `src/components` and `src/app/*`
- Class merge helper: `src/lib/utils.ts` (`cn`)

If you are new: "primitive" means low-level reusable elements (button, dialog, dropdown) that feature UIs compose.

## Styling stack

- Tailwind CSS is the primary styling method
- Radix + shadcn-style patterns are used for UI primitives
- `framer-motion` and `motion` are available for interactions/animations

## Navigation behavior

- `DesktopNavMenu` and `MobileNavMenu` are built from `NAV_ITEMS` in `src/app/constants.ts`
- Header auth CTA behavior depends on Clerk user state and UW email domain checks
